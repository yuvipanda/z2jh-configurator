# z2jh-configurator

A GUI based configurator for some admin tasks performed on a z2jh based JupyterHub

## Goals

The goal is to help offload *specific* admin work off Infrastructure
Admins for *specific* kinds of JupyterHubs - primarily ones focused on
*research*, where the end users have differing, heterogenous needs about
their environment and resources.

## Non-goals

Being a *generic z2jh configuration application* is an explicit non-goal.
If you are primarily targeting educational use cases where *Instructors*
make choices for their users about environment and resources, or where
*Infrastructure Admins* work closely with a specific set of users directly
to be super responsive to their needs, this might not be useful for you.

## Why?

The KubeSpawner `profileList` lets *end users* of the hub pick and choose
what kind of environment they want to use. This usually involves:

1. Picking what *image* to launch into, for their preferred environment
2. What kind of *resources* they want - memory, CPU, GPUs, disk sizes.

*Infrastructure admins* manage the underlying kubernetes cluster these users
land on, but currently also have to manage the `profileList`. This management,
particularly keeping the constantly changing list of images up to date, can
become quite a bit of [toil](https://sre.google/sre-book/eliminating-toil/).
And because infrastructure admin capacity is almost always limited, it might
also delay when users can use new images or other functionality.

`z2jh_configurator` separates management of the `profileList` from the underlying
infrastructure, and hands control of that to *JupyterHub admins*. They can change
images, provide appropriate resource guidelines and write useful descriptions
for end users. Their choices are still constrained by what Infrastructure
Admins provide - for example, information about available `NodeGroup`s are 
provided by Infrastructure admins, and this makes sense as those are just
*representations* of the underlying infrastructure that JupyterHub runs on.
Simply adding a `NodeGroup` in the UI isn't going to help when the underlying
nodes simply will not come up!

## Configurable options

JupyterHub admins can freely edit the following:

1. List of profiles, names and descriptions
2. List of images associated with each profile
3. NodeGroups that each profile should spawn into

Infrastructure admins provide *at deployment time* information about
the *list* of NodeGroups available, reflecting what has been provisioned.

## Loading NodeGroups from file

Infrastructure admins need to provide a list of NodeGroups that profiles can
launch into. This is not editable in the Admin interface because it must match
what is available in the Kubernetes cluster.

The config file is expected to be in the following format:

```json
[
  {
    "slug": "node-name-slug",
    "display_name": "Human Readable Name for this Node group",
    "node_selector": {
      "kubernetes-node-selector-key": "node-selector-value"
    },
  }
]
```

Once you have this file, it can be imported into the database with:

```bash
python manage.py loadnodegroups nodegroups.json 
```

The `loadnodegroups` command is idempotent, and does not delete any nodegroups
that no longer exist.
    
The contents of this file will be validated with a JSON Schema to ensure
useful error messages.
